Ingredients

10 (6 inch) corn tortillas
(plus everything in mexican_food.md)

Directions

Heat a large frying pan or griddle over a medium heat. Place one tortilla flat on the frying pan. After 1 minute flip the tortilla over. Sprinkle a little more than 1/4 cup cheese on the tortilla, followed by some olives, avocado, and hot pepper sauce. Place another tortilla on top to make a sandwich. Cover the quesadilla with a lid. After one minute, flip the quesadilla. When the cheese has melted on the inside, remove the quesadilla. Repeat with remaining ingredients.
Cut the quesadillas into triangles and serve.
