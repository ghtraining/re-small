Easier Vegan Scones 
==================

While the Easy Vegan Raisin Scones are my mom's recipe, these are my own tweak of it. I don't regularly have Earth Balance or oil to add to baking, but I always have lots of ripe bananas on hand. The "Easier" part comes from the fact that the fruit is just blended together. You can leave out the egg replacer as well, as the bananas take the place of butter/margarine/oil and eggs in function.

Yield: 16 scones 

Ingredients:

* 2 cups sifted flour
* 4 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 2 mandarin oranges, peeled.
* 2 teaspoons of egg replacer
* 4 tablespoons of water
* 1 ripe bananas
* 1/2 cup soy milk

Sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar and cinnamon. 
Peel the oranges. Blend together bananas and mandarin oranges until pureed. 
Whisk egg replacer and 4 tbsps hot water thoroughly in a liquid measuring cup. 
Add all liquids at once to flour mixture. 
Mix really well, batter will be moist. (These scones should not need to be kneaded)
Spread spoonfuls on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in hot oven 460F. for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
Let cool 10 minutes before enjoying piping hot!

2010-03-21: May need another banana and more sugar in the future. Try sprinkling crystallized sugar on top to make them "Alterra style"
